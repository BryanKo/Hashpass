# Welp

Welp is an Android application that grabs the current location of the user,
and queries the Dark Sky API to retrieve the weather. This information
(location and current weather) is then used to query the Yelp API, providing
a list of items associated with different categories. The list and times 
represented within the application is dynamic, meaning that it will show
the list of filters appropriate for the time if it is say 5:00pm, as well
as a list of filters and activities appropriate for the next few hours.

There are 10 branches, 11 including Master.
- alee, alee2: Anthony Lee's Branches
- bkko: Bryan Ko's Branches
- david, david2, david3, david4: David Ip's Branches
- desharma, desharma2: Deepak Sharma's Branches.

# Welp

Used branches extensively during the development process.
The work done on one branch by a person might have been
merged to master by another person. In addition, we used
pair programming for some instances, and committed the changes
under the identity of one person

There are 6 branches:
- Master
- alee, alee2: Anthony Lee's Branch
- bkko: Bryan Ko's Branch
- david: David Ip's Branch
- desharma: Deepak Sharma's Branch.
